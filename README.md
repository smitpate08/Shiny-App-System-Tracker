# System Tracker



## Scope

To track system usage based on Historical and Real-time data using web-based application. Below `Shiny` application is built using `ShinyDashboard` package in `R`.

## Highlevel Overview

Imagine you have `RDBMS`(Relational Database Management Sytem) that has real time data regarding which system is being used on which days, and you would like to track the system usage based on historical data as well as real time data that is available in `RDBMS`. Additionally, the System tracker should be user friendly. So that end-users can easily understand which systems are frequently used, and which ones are not. `Python` or `R` can provide the solution to this problem. In `Pyton`, web-based application can be bulit using `Dash` library, which can then be deployed on the server for end-users to use. In `R`, `Shiny` can be used to bulit web-based applcation. Like in `Python`, `Shiny` application can also be deployed on to the server, as shown below. The application is currently being hosted on Shinyapp.io server. Thus, with access to the link, end-users can easily use the application. Below infographics highlights the highlevel overview discussed above.
